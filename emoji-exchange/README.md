* How UI Should Work:
  * User opens the page and sees the `Connect Wallet` prompt.
  * Right after they connect their wallet:
    * If their account exists, it loads their account and shows both the `store` and their `user` balances.
    * If their account does not exist, the user sees the input box to enter their username. Once they click `initialize`, it loads their account and shows both the `store` and their `user` balances.

* Bugs:
  * [ ] Wallet doesn't auto-connect (but it does on Solana Twitter?).
  * [ ] Can't load store objects
  * [ ] Add CSS to make this thing look nice
